;;; Commentary:
;;
;; agent-review.el provides AI-powered code review for git changes.
;; It uses acp.el and agent-shell configurations to analyze staged
;; and unstaged changes, displaying findings in a tabulated list.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   M-x agent-review
;;
;; This will:
;; 1. Collect your git changes (staged and unstaged)
;; 2. Send them to an AI agent for review
;; 3. Display issues in a navigable list
;; 4. Allow jumping to issue locations with RET
;;
;; Report issues at https://github.com/nineluj/agent-review/issues
